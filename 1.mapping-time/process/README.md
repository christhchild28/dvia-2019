## Three Inquiries into the Nature of Time

For "Right Twice a Day", I wanted to explore three distinct questions about the nature of the relationship between humanity and time. Time is a valuable and yet intangible resource that shares an existential relationship to production, well-being and continuity. During my background research, I found that different cultures have diametrically opposed attitudes about time, and that the intra-cultural diversty of ideas (i.e. between cultures that share a common heritage and geography) could be even more prolific than the diversity of perceptions and ideas between cultures separated by history, geography and (yes, even) time!

## First Concept: Time is The Ephemeral Self against The Eternal Material 
In this concept, I express time as the "fading away" of the organic self while the material remains and accumulates over time. In Western, profit-oriented societies, time is linear, expensive and made scarce by the ceaseless demand to grow, acquire and "succeed". Time is a commodity that can be measured by the quantum of material objects produced. Alienation from the self (at once fragile and temporary) is the opportunity cost of winning in this paradigm. 

This clock is therefore a representation of the passing away of the most distinctive representation of our identity as human beings (the face) as time moves on, whereas the material things we acquire simultaneously increment and stand testament to our existence.

Hours: are represented by the number of earrings incrementing in 24-hour time
Minutes: each jewel in the tiara increments to 60 as an hour approaches
Seconds: each blink of the left eye represents the symbolic passing of an epoch. The diagonal pulsating line that disects the face represents milliseconds and the constant drumbeat of life's background noise.

A feature of the face "fades"/ "vanishes with each hour until at 0:00:00, nothing is visible but the material objects acquired at the end of the day: the diamond, the earrings, and the tiara. The "drumbeat of life also remains after the "passing away of the self".

## Second Concept: Time is Always chasing a Moving Target
In this variant, I address time in the alleogorical form of a robot (nodding again to the subtext of dissassociation from humanity in profit-driven cultures, in which human capital is interchangeable with "machinery"). The robot must hit a moving target (the red orb moves across the screen every minute) by the end of the day (at 0:00:00 the orb finally moves within range of the laser cannon so that it can be struck, resetting the clock and saving the robot from "termination"), recharing itself in each epoch (minute) in order to accomplish the task. The body of the robt has a display belt that indicates the number of hours left in the day to meet its fateful deadline. It's recharge indicator around the eyes track each of the 60 seconds that must pass before it can aim ita cannon at the Ominous red orb. 

Hours: utility belt counts the number of hours left in the day
Minutes: each cannon fire at the moving target/ the moving target's change in position
Seconds: the recharge indicator around the robot's eye/ head


##Third Concept: Time is Dissonance (The Metronome)
The axiom that "time is money" might map on to the nature of production in chaotic and interesting ways. If an American measures her time in terms of an "hourly rate" and the level of productivity needed to meet that goal, does this concept hold up when say, a Portuguese fisherman fails to hook a fish in two hours? (did he waste his time?), Does a Sicilian priest failing to make a convert on a Tuesday lose ground? Does the Chinese Philosophy student suffering from writers block miss opportunitties that can be quantified in monetary terms?

There is a dialectical conflict between our need to capture and maximize value from our "time well spent" and the stochastic pattern of life itself. 

This clock will be a "metronome" that tries to convert the chaotic rhythm of life into something that humans can bring order to. The central ellipse is randomly generated as a self-completing series of chords that appear in no particular order, which fill in red as the % of the day completes. On the left hand side of the ellipse is a matrix of randomly generating dots that track the number of seconds to 0:00:00. On teh right hand side is a self-sorting triangular arrangement of particles that gradually align perfectly as each hour progresses. At 0:00:00, the ellipse is complete and the dots on both sides are perfectly aligned.
