## Three Inquiries into the Nature of Time

For "Right Twice a Day", I wanted to explore three distinct questions about the nature of the relationship between humanity and time. Time is a valuable and yet intangible resource that shares an existential relationship to production, well-being and continuity. During my background research, I found that different cultures have diametrically opposed attitudes about time, and that the intra-cultural diversty of ideas (i.e. between cultures that share a common heritage and geography) could be even more prolific than the diversity of perceptions and ideas between cultures separated by history, geography and (yes, even) time!

## First Concept: Time: The Ephemeral Self and The Eternal Material 
In this concept, I express time as the "fading away" of the organic self while the material remains and accumulates over time. In Western, profit-oriented societies, time is linear, expensive and made scarce by the ceaseless demand to grow, acquire and "succeed". Time is a commodity that can be measured by the quantum of material objects produced. Alienation from the self (at once fragile and temporary) is the opportunity cost of winning in this paradigm. 

This clock is therefore a representation of the passing away of the most distinctive representation of our identity as human beings (the face) as time moves on, whereas the baubles we acquire simultaneously increment and stand testament to our existence.
